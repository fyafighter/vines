The certs/ directory contains the TLS certificates required for encrypting
client to server and server to server XMPP connections. TLS encryption
is mandatory for these streams so this directory must be configured properly.

The ca-bundle.crt file contains root Certificate Authority (CA) certificates.
These are used to validate certificates presented during TLS handshake
negotiation. The source for this file is the cacert.pem file available
at http://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html.

Any self-signed CA certificate placed in this directory will be considered
a trusted certificate. For example, let's say you're running the wonderland.lit
XMPP server and would like to allow verona.lit to connect a server to server
stream.  The verona.lit server hasn't purchased a legitimate TLS certificate
from a CA known in ca-bundle.crt. Instead, they've created a self-signed
certificate and sent it to you. Place the certificate in this directory
with a name of verona.lit.crt and it will be trusted. TLS connections from
verona.lit will now work.

For TLS connections to work for a virtual host, two files are needed in this
directory: <vhost_domain>.key and <vhost_domain>.crt.  The key file must contain
a PEM encoded private key.  Do not give this file to anyone.  This is your
private key so keep it private. The crt file must contain a PEM encoded TLS
certificate. This contains your public key so feel free to share it with other
servers. For example, you add a new virtual host named wonderland.lit to
the XMPP server. You need to run the 'vines cert wonderland.lit' command to
generate the private key file and the self-signed certificate file in this
directory. After running that command you will have a certs/wonderland.lit.key
and a certs/wonderland.lit.crt file.

Alternatively, you can purchase a TLS certificate from a CA (e.g. Go Daddy,
VeriSign, etc.) and place it in this directory. This will avoid the hassles
of managing self-signed certificates.
