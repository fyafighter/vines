# Each element below is a virtual host domain name that this
# server will service. Each host can use its own storage
# configuration or use the global storage, if none is provided
# here. TLS encryption is mandatory so each host must have a
# <domain>.crt and <domain>.key file in the conf/certs directory.
# A self-signed certificate will be generated for each host if these files
# are missing. You probably want to change 'localhost' to mydomain.tld.
